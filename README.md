Flying Swing Carousel Simulation
This repository contains a Python analysis of a 12-seater flying swing carousel. The code models key dynamics such as angular velocity, air drag, and angular elevation.

Language
Developed using Python 3

Requirements
To run the simulation, ensure the following are installed on your system:

 - Python 3
 - Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Installing Matplotlib
If Python is already installed, Matplotlib can be installed via pip:
    pip install matplotlib

Note:
If you are using an IDE or notebook environment with a separate Python installation (e.g., Jupyter, VS Code, Anaconda), please install Matplotlib in the corresponding environment.

To verify the installation, open a Python shell and run:
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

If no error occurs, Matplotlib is ready for use.
