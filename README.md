# swing-carousel
Flying Swing Carousel Simulation
This repository contains a Python analysis of a flying swing carousel. The code models key dynamics such as angular velocity, air drag, and angular elevation.


Language:
Developed using Python 3


Requirements:
To run the simulation, ensure the following are installed on your system:

 - Python 3
 - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
 - customtkinter (for the GUI version)


Installing Matplotlib
If Python is already installed, Matplotlib can be installed via pip:
    
    pip install matplotlib

Installing customtkinter
If Python is already installed, customtkinter can be installed via pip:
    
    pip install customtkinter

Note:
If you are using an IDE or notebook environment with a separate Python installation (e.g., Jupyter, VS Code, Anaconda), please install Matplotlib (or customtkinter) in the corresponding environment.


To verify the installation, open a Python shell and run:
    
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

If no error occurs, Matplotlib is ready for use.
